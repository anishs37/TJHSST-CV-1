# Computer Vision 1
This repository will contain my code for the Computer Vision 1 labs at TJHSST.

## Units

This course included five main labs, namely:
- Lab 1: Bresenham's Line Drawing Algorithm
- Lab 2: Convex Quadrilaterals
- Lab 3: Finding Closest Points
- Lab 4: Edge Detection
- Lab 5: Center Detection

Labs 4-5 were the major labs in this course, and will be extended upon further in the Computer Vision 2 course.
